# Deciphering Emojis: A Data Analysis Approach to Enhancing Sentiment Analysis in E-Commerce Reviews

## Overview

This project explores the role of emojis in sentiment analysis within e-commerce reviews. Using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, aim to integrate emoji sentiment to enhance the understanding of customer feedback.

## Objectives

- **Assess Multi-Feature Impact on Sentiment Classification:** Evaluate how individual review text, star ratings, total votes (likes on reviews), extracted emojis, and the integration of text with emojis as multi-features influence the performance of transformer-based deep neural networks in sentiment classification for Amazon product reviews across selected categories.

- **Enhance Emotion Detection Accuracy:** Investigate the enhancement in emotion detection accuracy and contextual understanding in natural language processing by integrating ratings, reviews, and emojis.

- **Analyze Emoji Impact in Sentiment Analysis:** Explore the impact of incorporating emojis as additional features in sentiment analysis, especially in the health and personal care category of Amazon product reviews, using a 5-class approach and compare it with a traditional 3-class approach.

- **Methodological Innovation in NLP:** Advance the methodology in natural language processing by leveraging multi-modal features to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sentiment analysis models.

- **Practical Implications for E-commerce Stakeholders:** Provide actionable insights for stakeholders in e-commerce platforms, focusing on the practical applications of advanced sentiment analysis techniques to enhance product insights and customer satisfaction.


## Methodology

This research investigates the role of emojis in e-commerce sentiment analysis through three hypotheses:

1. **Emoji Impact on Sentiment and Engagement:** This hypothesis involves the collection and analysis of product reviews, focusing on the correlation between the use of emojis and sentiment expressed in the review, star ratings, and total votes. The methodology includes data cleaning and normalization, sentiment analysis using NLP techniques, and statistical analysis to explore the relationship between emoji usage and various measures of customer engagement.

2. **Sentiment Analysis in Reviews with/without Emojis**: Segregates reviews into emoji-inclusive and non-emoji groups. Employs NLP for sentiment analysis and comparative study to assess emotional depth differences.

3. **Emoji-Infused Sentiment Analysis Models**: Develops a model integrating emoji sentiment with textual analysis. Trains the model on a dataset of text and emoji-filled reviews, benchmarking against standard models and evaluating using metrics like accuracy and precision.

   Each phase is designed to rigorously evaluate the corresponding hypothesis, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of consumer sentiments in e-commerce.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset of Amazon e-commerce reviews, encompassing a range of products and customer feedback. 
The details of dataset are available in `data` directory.
