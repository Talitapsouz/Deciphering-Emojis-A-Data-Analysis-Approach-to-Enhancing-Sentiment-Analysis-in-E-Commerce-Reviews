# Deciphering Emojis: A Data Analysis Approach to Enhancing Sentiment Analysis in E-Commerce Reviews

## Overview

This project explores the role of emojis in sentiment analysis within e-commerce reviews. Using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, we aim to integrate emoji sentiment to enhance the understanding of customer feedback.

## Objectives

- Assess the impact of emojis on sentiment analysis.
- Identify trends in emoji usage across different product categories.
- Develop and evaluate a sentiment analysis model including emojis.
- Advance the understanding of data analytics in e-commerce settings.

## Methodology

This research investigates the role of emojis in e-commerce sentiment analysis through three hypotheses:

1. **Emoji Usage by Product Category**: Involves data collection, cleaning, and segmentation from various e-commerce platforms. Analyzes emoji frequency and patterns across categories like Toys, Apparel, Electronics, and visualizes data to understand emotional undertones.

2. **Sentiment Analysis in Reviews with/without Emojis**: Segregates reviews into emoji-inclusive and non-emoji groups. Employs NLP for sentiment analysis and comparative study to assess emotional depth differences.

3. **Emoji-Infused Sentiment Analysis Models**: Develops a model integrating emoji sentiment with textual analysis. Trains the model on a dataset of text and emoji-filled reviews, benchmarking against standard models and evaluating using metrics like accuracy and precision.

   Each phase is designed to rigorously evaluate the corresponding hypothesis, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of consumer sentiments in e-commerce.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset of Amazon e-commerce reviews, encompassing a range of products and customer feedback.
